mailview - A program to view emails
===

Pretty simple really, it should take an email and display its
contents. Sadly emails are not that simple, inline pdfs, strange
character sets, multipart/alternate parts containing different data
and just what scope should multipart messages with a
Content-Disposition filename have?

Basically, partly as a utility and partly as an exercise in masochism,
I want to make a program that will render absolutely any email in a
sane manner. Then hopefully I can get back to making a sane email
composer.
